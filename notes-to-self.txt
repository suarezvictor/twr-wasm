** builds/makefiles **
move licxx build artifacts out of lib & include in dev, and put in source/libcxx/build folder, then add a copy to correct location in build scripts?  
add to clang --lto-O3 \ # Aggressive link-time optimizations 
add to clang -flto \ # Add metadata for link-time optimizations
use wasm2wat on helloworld to see code size optimizations possible.
what is -lwasm? clang --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown-wasm -o test.wasm test.c -lwasm
change my examples to all use one (the same) makefile?
double check "C_Cpp.default.defines": is correct location in workspace file. is it needed in makefile? can it be moved to vscode
give a warning when trying to buildazure and no source found (from npm). Or don't include the script in the build.
in the npm package add source?
have buildazure also build lib/twr.a  ( i put it in merge-dev-and-build-and-commit.sh, but this might not be the correct place? )
buildall / clean needs to delete include folder before rebuilding it
change build all examples scripts to also rebuild the libraries make files
consider creating a sysroot -- see https://danielmangum.com/posts/wasm-wasi-clang-17/

** docs/examples **
for parameter.md, add an explanation of bool type
for parameter.md, provide more detail in the js object section, and add working examples to call.c example.
when the examples/index is running locally, the link View complete docs does not work
be more precise in parameters.md (and add callc examples) on both unsigned and signed int parameters and returns
refresh examples readme, including table with links to examples
add titles/descriptions to top of all examples
Add array example to function test
resolve this comment on parameters.md: kinda nitpicky but worth noting you can also call functions that use the multivalue proposal and their return value is returned as an array
blog or more in depth article ideas:  
	integrating C stdio and JS/TS
	low level wasm (ie, lessons learned building a c/c++ runtime on top of wasm)
	tsconfig/alias/includes/etc
	getting your source code to load in the debugger
	passing/returning values, drawing to canvas from C++, creating a WebAssembly "terminal", WebAssembly STDIO, 
add c++ hello world example
add single line python example? Copy the file server.py from the examples folder to your project folder where your index.html resides. 
add a sitemap for examples source and live examples https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap
add analytics JS header code (azure insights or google analytics eg)
in balls demo (and other demos), await appears to not work in browser older than 3 years.  Add try/catch and report browser error (currently shows error only in console)
add await and dynamic import to my index.html compatibility tester?
use of await (and maybe dynamic import) has limited demos working with older browsers.  Add to docs?  Create a test page index.html with no await?
document issues with await in examples readme?
determine if this is still true then add back to key feature list in doc and readme: - linked with helloworld,  code+data < 3K
weird (ver small) min (in title bar) of balls debug build.  Window seems to need to be wide.
got a large negative number for min fps running balls demo from npmjs readme link.  Wasn't immediately reproducible.
add an example that shows how to call back into javascript from C
index.html/examples/unbundled switch is hard coded to web site so i cant test it locally  (i think this is fixed, verify)
why do bundled examples flash when launched in debugger with file versions?
balls example still shows error async.html:1 An import map is added after module script load was triggered.
doc? -- if (strcmp(b, "1.234568e+2")!=0) return 0;  // NOTE gcc printf %e gives 1.234568e+02
and 	if (strcmp(b, "1.00000e+7")!=0) return 0;    // GCC give 1e+07
sometimes in ball demo steptime==0.  Gens an assert.  Need to make sure this code path is okay, but seems to work.
remove this line in balls for better performance:  m_canvas.fillRect(0, 0, m_width, m_height);
balls performance analysis -- when lots of balls, "drawSeq" is 1/3 of time, moveAllBallsis 1/3, isCollisionNext 12%, moveSingleBall 17%
not sure why "W" of "Hello World" in stdio-canvas example looks funny
twr_malloc_debug_stats() is undocumented.  Either document, or rename to __malloc_debug_stats
callc seems to be build with deubg mode, but not labeled as such in index.html

* api to add **
allow zero size malloc (take out warning, return null which free will handle)
add fputs
add asynchronous (non blocking) input using div and canvas tags
add to printf the %p, %lu format specifiers.
add to printf int64_t support (<inttypes.h> for the PRId64 macro.)
Class DivText
Class CanvasConsole
Class CanvasDraw
improve doc on returning values from C functions (and passing values to C functions)
add c16rtomb
add gets (currently there is just twr_gets)?
add buffer size to io_gets()
add twr_getkey() as well as existing twr_getchar().
add io_inkey.  Its mostly implemented
add implementation of io_chk_brk
add some JS Date functions
add more JS Math functions
add ability to query global browser variables.  eg   val location = window["location"]; 
    std::string search = location["search"].as<std::string>();
add ability to pass JS object to C/C++
add twr_cache_free_cache() api and use in windowed console in some places?  Or set max cache size in malloc cache API?
add overload: fillText(text, x, y, maxWidth)
add D2D for textAlign (set)
add last new call (fillchar) to balls test c++ class
add function that shows a wait icon, for use eg when loading wasm code
add js bigint support? https://v8.dev/features/wasm-bigint
add 'front-end' keyword
add int ungetc(int ch, FILE *stream);  // place holder only, not implemented
add a function that gets the full key, like "Shift"?

** unit tests improvements **
memstats - clean up output (everything in hex + dec).  Verify numbers.  avail seems small given the size of the code.
unittests are in two places: tests and tests-user -- consolidate?
unittests malloc failing tests-user
add automated tests to units-tests that use utf8 prints then read terminal memory and check utf32 values
add tests for div, abort
add unittest for memmove() in string.c
add unitests for fprintf with stderr, stdin, stdout
add test cases for all new string functions.  example strcoll. _l versions, etc.
malloc_unit_test() can't be called twice because cache mem tests don't clean up. fix.
some of the length printf tests are failing with optimization on.  Why? 

** existing API implementation improvements **
move twrConDrawSeq into jscon driver
add buffer size to io_mbgets(stream1, buffer);
should getProxyParams() bet getProxyArgs() ?
change #define D2D_ to enums
update mod.callC() so it will take a list of functions parameters, not just an array
callC calls are slow (i did a performance test, and way way slower then the import calls)
add await and non await versions of malloc, free, callC, so no await needed in non async versions
change twrWasmModule to not use 'await' on callC, malloc, etc calls?
add stack trace to assert
have assert trap
mod assert to use twr_conlog()
a form like this can be used to improve GetVALUE() functions in wasmModule: const z = new Uint8ClampedArray(buffer, 1, 4); ?
need to improve implementation of getU8Arr/32combine magic word and size in malloc from two alloc units to one alloc unit.
seed rand() with time upon startup
add overflow detection and set errno in stdclib conversion functions
need better overflow detection? see square example, enter very large number
strtoull, strtod etc do not set the errno ERANGE and return correct value (see strtoull doc)
malloc is slow
check out malloc and other crt at https://github.com/rebol/rebol
if (twr_strcmp(buffer, "0.100000")!=0) return 0;  // see unittests.c comment
substitution strings not support in mod.divLob(), eg console.log("The price is %.2f.", price);      
printf() is missing a few bits
realloc() needs improving
std c functions that are supposed to be declared with 'restrict' parameters are not because I can't get them to compile.
is_terminal -> should it be renamed twr_is_terminal, or better, io_isterminal() ?
replace rnd() with call to js
//twr_snprintf(b, sizeof(b), "%6.2d", -5);   // NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
printf ("%f", 1.0/0.0); displays "Infinity"
change memmove from C to wast?
add option for debuginfo display. 
    For example, stack size, heap size, etc.  Mem high water mark.  both crt and ts info.  
   add debuginfo option to display graphic 2d calls and sizes
   malloc alloc & free warnings
twrDiv vs twrCanvas cursor management discrepancies
   - io_putc will call twrDiv::charOut(), which used block cursor and will enable focus on the div when curor enabled
   - io_putc uses its internal default implementation ofr twr::Canvas, which uses underscore as cursor and can't set the canvas focus
   - io_putc logic doesn't seem right - it assumes if io->charout.io_putc not set, the console is windowed, and if 
      io->charout.io_putc is set, it just sort of punts for windowed?  
change canvas cursor (hollow) when canvas doesn't have focus
add check of response.ok to fetchAndPutURL 0 fetch (see loadWasm)
io_putc() used unsigned char, which will fail with EOF, and unicode code points (should i add that?)
bug: setlocale(LC_ALL, NULL) should return different locals separated by semicolon.  see https://chatgpt.com/c/30a0e4f7-8e04-427c-9943-950e74633292
rename nstrcopy to __nstrcopy
Add tests for utf-32/16/etc and add to docs -- see https://chatgpt.com/c/30a0e4f7-8e04-427c-9943-950e74633292

** os notes - ideas **
cd url-http, url-ftp
   default file-package (aka root file-package)
cd file-package
file-package: could be a zip.  could be json file. if json, points to resources that could be "local" server, other server, files, links, etc
.wasm executable can open files in the file package
options: traditional hierarchy, or alt is list of assets with attributes/twr_malloc_debug_stats that can be found via search or opened via name
example: awbasic
cd http://basic-games.com
awbasic checkers
issue: where is awbasic.wasm?  on the file-package, or in a "path" package?
example of case with no hierarchy
cd http://basic-games.com
dir tag=board-games
dir board-games # default to tag
dir tag=class-computing-mag
dir tag=assembly and tag!=6502
dir stars>3
dir name=eliza
each entry has a UUID and then meta data (tag, stars, description, etc)
UUID_Array=findFiles("tag=board-games"); returns <vector>
file=open(UUID_Array[0])

** misc **
consider adding this comment to importmaps, if true:  This relative importmap only works when a file URL is used.  If a local web server, this relative URL attempts to go outside root.
is there an importmap url that will work with file:/// and localserver?
add event-dom-loaded taoo code to eliminate importmap errors
buildazure.sh copies the .ts source, but not the C source or example .c source.  Is this correct??
remove nul? ala twrSleep:this.null,
update our build scripts to check the tool version numbers and warn when they don’t match what we document.  
possible api abstraction: https://github.com/floooh/sokol
something like this might be a good way to install: git clone git@github.com:EmNudge/watlings.git, cd watlings, npm install
fix the two libc++ build warnings (empty struct size and ELAST)
I pulled some of the headers from LLVM that are under the Apache-2.0 license.  Does that affect what needs to be in my top-level LICENSE file?
in keyEventProcess, cntr-c etc are not handled.  Add support?
add a io_canvas option for wide/narrow chars to select between const sampleText="          "; AND const sampleText=String.fromCharCode(2593).repeat(6);
mbgetc when locale is C returns "?" -- is that what i want to happen?
would be nice to be able to "copy" out of the IoWindow terminal
are full source paths (from my dev folder) being included in twrd.a -- investigate
should i changed boot up default to "" instead of "C"?  if so, should i change C to be ASCII all the time? Ie, remove utf8 "c" limited support.
remove these two lines: console.log("keyDownDiv SKIPPED: ",ev.key, ev.code, ev.key.codePointAt(0), ev);
ADD ansi terminal escape codes for windows term
\x1b[30m - Black
\x1b[31m - Red
\x1b[32m - Green
\x1b[33m - Yellow
\x1b[34m - Blue
\x1b[35m - Magenta
\x1b[36m - Cyan
\x1b[37m - White
\x1b[0m - Reset to default

rename windows console to terminal?
better modularize twrWasmModule & twrWasmModuleAsync classes -- see notes 5-11-24 paper.
need a better system than this to check for crossOriginIsolated.  Check in module constructor?
         if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { // this check only works if window valid
            if (!crossOriginIsolated && !(window.location.protocol === 'file:')) 
                throw new Error("twrSignal constructor, crossOriginIsolated="+crossOriginIsolated+". See SharedArrayBuffer docs.");
        }
cstart.o (cstart.s) - is it handled correctly? double check.
remind my self why modasync uses const urlToLoad = new URL(pathToLoad, document.URL); and not new Worker(new URL('twrmodworker.js', import.meta.url), {type: "module" });
see C:\GitHubClonesDev\llvm-project\build\include\c++\v1\cstdlib for list of C stdlib funcs to implement, and note about order of includes
(unreachable) is one way to term a WebAssembly function and throw an exception in JS (used in twr_trap). Are there others?
/0 in hangs with no exception or error.  Investigation shows:  Integer /0 results in exception in called function.  Double /0 returns infinity
check this out: https://github.com/hybridgroup/mechanoid
awbasic gnu build needs ioconsole support - it disappeared when i took out twr-wasm
awbasic - test all workspace buildsupdate awbasic to convert codes before calling io_putc():
	else if (c >=192)	// 192 to 255 are shortcuts for 0 to 63 spaces, respectively
	{
		for (int i=0; i < (c-192); i++)
			io_putc(io, ' ');

		return;
	}
twrmodbase.copyString() could be made more performant - replace for loop with a copy and use encodeinto()
--- better way to decode string ---
function consoleLogString(offset, length) {
  const bytes = new Uint8Array(memory.buffer, offset, length);
  const string = new TextDecoder("utf8").decode(bytes);
  console.log(string);
}
investigate exceptions more: https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/exceptions.html
----
Debugging Exceptions
Stack Traces
For native Wasm exceptions, when ASSERTIONS is enabled, uncaught exceptions will print stack traces for debugging. 
ASSERTIONS is enabled by default in -O0 and disabled in optimized builds (-O1 and above). 
To display Wasm function names in stack traces, you also need –profiling-funcs (or -g or -gsource-map).
 Google didn't index a given page because it's a duplicate of a different page, and none of the pages was indicated as the canonical one using the canonical tag.

In JavaScript, you can also examine the stack traces using WebAssembly.Exception.prototype.stack property. For example:

try {
  ... // some code that calls WebAssembly
} catch (e) {
  // Do something with e.stack
  console.log(e.stack);
}
Stack traces within Wasm code are not supported in JavaScript-based exceptions.
----

regarding: std::locale("").name().c_str() - this returns a name of "", as opposed to "en-US.UTF-8" (for example).  
This is not what I expected based on various internet documentation.  But after lots of looking at the source and varous tests, it appears to be correct.  
Note that on both clang++ and g++, this will throw an exception, which also isn't what I expected. In TWR, even though the name is not as expected, it does work as a locale when used.

From old Makefile dev:

# The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies.
# What is commonly known as the LLVM bitcode file format (also, sometimes anachronistically known as bytecode)
# is actually two things: a bitstream container format and an encoding of LLVM IR into the container format.
# llvm-link takes several LLVM bitcode files and links them together into a single LLVM bitcode file.
# The llc command compiles LLVM source inputs into assembly language for a specified architecture
# llc doc - The choice of architecture for the output assembly code is automatically determined from the input file
# The -cc1 argument indicates that the compiler front-end is to be used, and not the gcc driver.

#	clang -cc1 -emit-llvm-bc -triple=wasm32-unknown-unknown-wasm -std=c11  glue.c -o out/glue.bc

#	llc -O3 -filetype=obj out/wasm.bc -o out/glue.o
#	wasm-ld out/glue.o -o out/awbasic.wasm  --no-entry --allow-undefined  --import-memory --export=glue --export=get_heap_base

# and wasm2wat awbasic.wasm -o aw.asm

----
when converting from -cc1 to the standard gcc compatible clang options, i discovered the following when creating twr-a:
the gcc ar (original ar i used) generated output that wasm-ld would not accept.  However, I found this work around:
   (using -cc1 clang options to compile)
	llvm-ar cr $(OBJOUTDIR)/twr-a0.bc $(OBJECTS)
	llvm-link -o $(OBJOUTDIR)/twr-a.bc $(OBJOUTDIR)/twr-a0.bc
	llc -filetype=obj $(OBJOUTDIR)/twr-a.bc -o $(TWRA)

   (ar works as well as llvm-ar)

in addition this works with the "gcc" style clang.
	llvm-ar crsv $(TWRA) $(OBJECTS)

however, files that used to work like this:
__attribute__((export_name("twr_wasm_init")))
void twr_wasm_init(int pf, unsigned long mem_size) 

now required an wasm-ld option like: --export=twr_wasm_init 

note: there is supposedly an wasm-ar, but i could not find it. It is supposedly part of emscripten.

as a result, i went back to the first option in this comment
