# Easier WebAssembly with twr-wasm<br>Documentation and Examples
Version 2.5.0

twr-wasm is a simple, lightweight and easy to use library for building C/C++ WebAssembly code directly with clang. Run C/C++ code in a web browser. Legacy code, libraries, full applications, or single functions can be integrated with JavaScript and TypeScript. twr-wam solves some common use cases with less work than the more feature rich emscripten. 

**Key Features:**

- build `.wasm` modules using C/C++ using clang directly (no wrapper)
- from JavaScript load `.wasm` modules, call C/C++ functions, and access wasm memory
- comprehensive console support for `stdin`, `stdio`, and `stderr`.

    - in C/C++, print and get characters to/from `<div>` tags in your HTML page
    - in C/C++, print and get characters to/from a `<canvas>` based "terminal"
    - localization support, UTF-8, and windows-1252 support

- the optional TypeScript `class twrWasmModuleAsync` can be used to:

    - integrate a C/C++ Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) with JavaScript
    - integrate a C/C++ CLI or Shell with JavaScript
    - In JavaScript `await` on blocking/synchronous C/C++ functions. 

- 2D drawing API for C/C++ compatible with JavaScript Canvas
- audio playback APIs for C/C++
- create your own C/C++ APIs using TypeScript by extending `class twrLibrary`
- standard C library optimized for WebAssembly
- libc++ built for WebAssembly
- comprehensive examples and documentation
- TypeScript and JavaScript support

## Hello World

Here is the simplest `twr-wasm` example.

```c title="helloworld.c"
#include <stdio.h>

void hello() {
    printf("hello, world!\n");
}
```

```html title="index.html"
<head>
   <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
   <div id="twr_iodiv"></div>

   <script type="module">
      import {twrWasmModule} from "twr-wasm";
      
      const mod = new twrWasmModule();
      await mod.loadWasm("./helloworld.wasm");
      await mod.callC(["hello"]);
   </script>
</body>
```

## Why?
The [Wasm Runtime Limitations](more/wasm-problem.md) section explains why a library like twr-wasm is needed to use WebAssembly.

## Limitations 
 - libc++ not built with exceptions enabled
 - some standard C library functions are not 100% implemented
 - Designed to work with a browser.  Not tested with or designed to work with node.js  
 - Not all of compile-rt is ported (but most bits you need are)
