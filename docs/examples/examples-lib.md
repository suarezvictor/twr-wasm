# class twrLibrary Example
## What It Does
This example is a twr-wasm Library that implements functions that can be called by your C/C++ code.  A twr-wasm Library is written in TypeScript, and derives from the class twrLibrary.
  
The lib example demos:

* Creating functions in TypeScript that can be called from C/C++
* Posting Events to C
* Implementing blocking as well as non-blocking functions
