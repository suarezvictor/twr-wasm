# WebAssembly C/C++ Examples
## Overview
These C and C++ examples demonstrate how to create different types of WebAssembly (wasm) programs with the twr-wasm library.

These are good examples to use as starting points for your own Wasm projects.

These examples are a good place to learn how to configure clang and wasm-ld to compile and link C/C++ code for use with WebAssembly (wasm).

## Examples Overview
Each of these examples are designed to illustrate how to use a feature of twr-wasm.


| Name | Description | Link |
| -----| ----------- | ---- |
| helloworld | A very simple C Wasm example to get you started | [helloworld](examples-helloworld.md) |
| stdio-div | This simple C program demos inputting and<br>printing characters to a `div` tag | [stdio-div](examples-stdio-div.md) |
| stdio-canvas |This simple C program demos writing and inputting<br>from a `<canvas>` tag that twr-wasm configures<br>as a windowed "mini-terminal" | [stdio-canvas](examples-stdio-canvas.md)|
| balls | These fun Bouncing Balls are written in C++ and demo the<br>2D drawing APIs with a C++ Canvas wrapper class | [balls](examples-balls.md) |
| pong | A simple game of Pong written in C++ to demo 2D drawing APIs with a C++ canvas wrapper class and taking user input from JS | [pong](examples-pong.md)
| maze | This is an old Win32 program ported to wasm<br>and demos the 2D Draw APIs | [maze](examples-maze.md) |
| fft | A demo of calling a C library to perform an FFT<br>that is graphed in TypeScript | [fft](examples-fft.md) |
| callC | A demo of passing and returning values between<br>JavaScript and Wasm module | [callc](examples-callc.md) |
| tests | twr-wasm unit tests | [tests](/examples/dist/tests/index.html) |
| tests-user | "cli" for tests using libc++ and `<canvas>` | [tests-user](/examples/dist/tests-user/index.html) |
| tests-libcxx | Smoke test for libc++.  Shows how to use libc++. | [tests-libcxx](examples-libcxx.md) |

## Building the Examples

See [Example Readme](https://github.com/twiddlingbits/twr-wasm/blob/main/examples/readme.md) for more information on building and running the examples.
