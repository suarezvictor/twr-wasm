# Multi-io -Multiple Console Example
## What It Does
This example demos six simultaneous consoles:

- Two "`<div>` tag as character streaming" consoles
- Two "`<canvas> ` tag as a character terminal"
- Two "`<canvas> ` tag  as 2D draw surface" consoles.
  
The multi-io example also demonstrates:

* Creating consoles in JavaScript/TypeScript
* Using consoles in C/C++ and JavaScript/TypeScript
* Mixing multiple Consoles
* Using multiple .wasm modules using the same console
* Inputting, printing, and drawing to consoles
